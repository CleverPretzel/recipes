    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose or plain flour</li>
      <li>&frac14; cup granulated sugar or sweetener</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>&frac14; teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>&frac12; teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1&frac34; cups milk</li>
      <li>&frac14; cup butter</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>Caramel sauce (optional)</li>
      <li>Fresh strawberries (optional)</li>
      <li>Nuts (optional)</li>
      <li>Mint (optional)</li>
      <li>Powdered sugar (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.</li>
      <li>Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay). (The batter will be thick and creamy in consistency. If you find the batter too thick — doesn't pour off the ladle or out of the measuring cup smoothly — fold a couple tablespoons of extra milk into the batter at a time until reaching desired consistency).</li>
      <li>Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle.</li>
      <li>Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour &frac14; cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.</li>
      <li>When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
      <li>Serve with any optional toppings, or enjoy plain!</li>
    </ol>
