    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 slices Texas toast, thick sliced sandwich bread, sourdough bread or any other favorite bread</li>
      <li>4 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
      <li>4 slices medium cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>4 slices Gouda cheese</li>
      <li>4 slices Havarti cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Spread &frac12; Tbsp of butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
      <li>Set a cast iron skillet or heavy non-stick pan over medium/low heat. If using a griddle, it should be at 275˚F. Place 2 slices of bread in the skillet with the butter side down.</li>
      <li>Stack cheeses on one piece of toast: cheddar, havarti, then gouda. Once the bread is golden brown, close the sandwich with the crisp sides on the outside.</li>
      <li>Continue cooking until the bread is a rich golden brown, flipping once and press down lightly to help the bread stick to the cheese. Total cooking time should be 5-6 minutes. Keep the heat on medium-low for the bread to toast slowly, giving your cheese a chance to fully melt and adhere to the bread.</li>
      <li>Once you see the cheese has melted and breads are browned, remove to a plate and cut in half diagonally to serve. Repeat with the next sandwich.</li>
    </ol>
