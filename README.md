## Recipes

## Description
A collection of simple recipes. To create this project, I used CLI, git, GitLab and HTML.

Features:
- 3 recipes
- An image for each recipe
- A description for each recipe
- An ingredient list for each recipe
- Cooking instructions for each recipe

Background:
I have started to learn to code 3 years ago, and have learned a lot since then. I am close to launch on my first project with monetization quality. However, my knowledge is not 100% complete. I have chosen The Odin Project (TOP) as a resource to continue learning, and I decided to start from scratch - to make sure that I cover everything. So, while I did know 95% of the material covered up to here already, the other 5% I did not. For example, I learned how to write *good* commit messages. I am excited to keep going with TOP until completion.
