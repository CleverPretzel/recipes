## Recipes

## Description
A collection of simple recipes. To create this project, I used CLI, git, GitLab and HTML.

Features:
- 10 recipes, sorted by appetizer/main course/dessert
- An image for each recipe (acknowledgement down below)
- An ingredient list for each recipe
- Cooking instructions for each recipe

Background:
I have started to learn to code 3 years ago, and have learned a lot since then. I am close to launch on my first project with monetization quality. However, my knowledge is not 100% complete. I have chosen The Odin Project (TOP) as a resource to continue learning, and I decided to start from scratch - to make sure that I cover everything. So, while I did know 95% of the material covered up to here already, the other 5% I did not. For example, I learned how to write *good* commit messages. I am excited to keep going with TOP until completion.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Usage
Read recipe. Gather required ingredients. Cook according to cooking instructions. Put into mouth, chew and enjoy.

## Support
For any questions email giedrepappas@gmail.com

## Roadmap
Once I finish the CSS section, I will be updating this project to include styles.

## Contributing
This is a personal project made 100% by yours truly.
